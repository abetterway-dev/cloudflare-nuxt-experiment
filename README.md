# Nuxt 3 - Testing Services with Cloudflare Workers

I have been moving my services to Cloudflare Workers and I wanted to test them here before putting them in projects.

## To Create database

```sh
npx wrangler d1 create <DB_NAME>
```

## To Create KV Namespace

```sh
wrangler kv:namespace create <YOUR_NAMESPACE>
```
